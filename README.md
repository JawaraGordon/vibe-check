# Vibe Check

Welcome to "Vibe Check," a cooperative music-themed game where music meets gameplay in an immersive arcade experience. Players collaborate to choose a song type, then type words they think match the vibe of the music. Players receive points for correct answers while listening to 60 seconds of their chosen song. Players win if they can match more words than the top score for that song!

## Game Loop Overview

1. **Game Start**
   - **Experience:** Retro-modern vibe with a neon-drenched start screen.
   - **Action:** Players decide to begin their musical journey by pressing the "Start" button.

2. **Game Setup**
   - **Mechanism:** Players set their desired game intensity through an interactive slider.
   - **Impact:** The game adjusts the song tempo and overall intensity based on the average of the players' choices.

3. **Countdown**
   - **Excitement:** A dynamic neon countdown transitions players smoothly into gameplay.

4. **Game Play**
   - **Arena:** Players engage in collaborative gameplay as the selected song plays in the background.
   - **Interaction:** Players type words that match the song's "vibe" to score points. They cannot use any of the same words as their teammate, and they cannot use the same word twice.

5. **Game Results**
   - **Showcase:** The game results screen displays the game score and combined players' score, along with an image that tells players if they "checked" the right vibes. Players can choose to start a new round or quit the game by selecting from the buttons at the bottom of the screen.
   - **Visuals:** Thematic animations and visuals enrich the scoring experience.

6. **Intensity Selection Revisited**
   - **Evolution:** Players revisit the intensity selection to refine their experience based on previous gameplay.
   - **Control:** This loop allows players to continuously shape the game's challenge level and influences subsequent song selections.
